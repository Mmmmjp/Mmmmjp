## 🚀Projects
I’m actively working on projects to solidify my learning, often starting with tutorials or textbooks as a foundation. I always strive to enhance them by incorporating new features and improving styling with CSS to make each project unique. One example of my original work is [Vision Grid](https://github.com/Mmmmjp/Vision_grid), where I applied these principles to create a distinctive project.

If you have any advice or suggestions for further improving my projects, I’d love to hear from you! Feel free to share your thoughts or submit a pull request.


## 💬 A Quick Note
